/**
 * Author: Simon Lindholm
 * Description: 
 * Find the smallest i in $[a,b]$ that maximizes $f(i)$, assuming that $f(a) < \dots < f(i) \ge \dots \ge f(b)$.
 * To reverse which of the sides allows non-strict inequalities, change the < marked with (A) to <=, and reverse the loop at (B).
 * To minimize $f$, change it to >, also at (B).
 * Requires Abelian Group "S" (op, inv, id)
 * Time: O(log(b-a))
 * Memory: O(0)
 * Status: not yet tested
