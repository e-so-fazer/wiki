Directives for building and maintaining team wiki

- General:
English language only

- Wiki PDF:
Short, but complete
Basic directives to follow in contest
Important pieces of code: summary, implementation, usage
Important theorems and facts

- Wiki content:
Include author, description, time and memory complexity, observations/restrictions
Include testing status: stress-tests, relevant problems where used
Use of comments to explain usage?

- Wiki code:
Should be working correctly:
    Tested at chanllenging problems
    Using intended complexity (and good constant factor)
    Compiling in C++17 and C++20 (if possible)
Should follow hierarchy:
    Basic data as containers/types
    Basic processes as functions
    Union of processes and/or data as structs
    Outer processes should not worry about inner's details
Should be as abstract as possible:
    Use of template types internally
    Easy modification of variable processes
    Support generalization of original functionality
Should be as short as possible:
    Avoid extra functions and data
    Avoid too many whitespaces and lines
    Use macros and short names

- Stress tests:
Brute force small cases
Add few big/corner cases

- Wiki Theorems/Techniques:
Basic enunciation
Effects/observations
Restrictions/special cases
